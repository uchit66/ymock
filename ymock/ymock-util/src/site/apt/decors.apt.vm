Decors

  Log an event like this:

+--
  import com.ymock.util.Logger;
  class Foo {
    void bar(int value) {
      final long start = System.nanoTime();
      // some operations
      Logger.debug(
        this,
        "bar(%d): done in %[nano]d",
        value,
        System.nanoTime() - start
      );
    }
  }
+--

  You will see something like this in log:

---
[DEBUG] Foo: #bar(1234): done in 3.45ms
---

  Nano-seconds will be formatted as time through a built-in yMock "decor":
  {{{./apidocs/com/ymock/util/decors/NanoDecor.html}<<<NanoDecor>>>}}.
  In order to define your own decor just implement <<<java.util.Formattable>>>
  and annotate it with
  {{{./apidocs/com/ymock/util/Decor.html}<<<com.ymock.util.Decor>>>}}, for example:

+--
import com.ymock.util.Decor;
import java.util.Formattable;
import java.util.Formatter;

@Decor(name = "foo")
public final class DataDecor implements Formattable {
    private final transient Data data;
    public DataDecor(final Data dat) {
        this.data = dat;
    }
    @Override
    public void formatTo(final Formatter formatter, final int flags,
        final int width, final int precision) {
        formatter.format("%s", this.data.getSomeValueOutOfIt());
    }

}
+--
