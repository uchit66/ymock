Introduction

  yMock (pronounced "<why-mock>") is a mocking library for
  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_code}Legacy Code}}:

[tikz/index-components.png] UML Components Diagram

  Legacy Code depends on a third-party resource, which
  can't be used during testing, for many reasons. You find the
  place in the Legacy Code ("adapter"), which is responsible
  for making calls to such a third-party resource. You re-route
  all calls to a custom "mock", which instantiates
  {{{./ymock-client/apidocs/com/ymock/client/YMockClient.html}<<<YMockClient>>>}}.
  Responses received you send back to the "adapter".

  In the unit test you instantiate
  {{{./ymock-server/apidocs/com/ymock/server/YMockServer.html}<<<YMockServer>>>}},
  which listens to HTTP requests from the client. You configure the
  server with custom "matchers" and "responses".

  Now you can safely call Legacy Code and mimic the
  behavior of the third-party resource from inside the unit test.

  See some more {{{./usage.html}Java examples}}.

  Besides that the framework provides a number of useful instruments
  for simplification of typical operations like logging, exception
  class instantiation, etc. Read more in {{{./ymock-util}<<<ymock-util>>>}} sub-module.
